&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="CHANGES">Details</a>)
</p>
<p>
This is a binary distribution of <span class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp;4
on Linux PCs with x86_64 compatible processors (Pentium, Ryzen, Athlon, 
Xeon, ...). 
It is maintained by <a
href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck">Frank Lübeck</a>.
Any reports or suggestions are welcome.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to install <span class="pkg">GAP</span> on Linux by synchronizing 
via the internet with a reference installation. Some features are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="pkg">GAP</span> is already compiled with GMP and readline
support. Binaries are linked such that only the C-library of any
distribution from the last 5 years is needed at runtime.</li>
<li>Almost all distributed packages are fully installed, this is the main 
point which
makes installation much easier compared to a  direct installation  from 
the sources. The binaries are distributed with all needed libraries.
</li>
<li>
Installation is by choosing a directory and two easy commands, as explained
below (ok, some packages need other external software, see below). 
</li>
<li>
Upgrades can be done by one simple command. They are very fast and save
network bandwidth.
</li>
<li>
...
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to get <span class="pkg">GAP</span> via this service</h2>
<p>
(and not directly from the <a
href="https://www.gap-system.org/Download/">
<span class="pkg">GAP</span> site</a>.)
</p>

<p>
You need: a machine with PC architecture (x86_64 compatible) 
running under 
<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>, a directory with about 2600&nbsp;MB of
free space and the <code>rsync</code> program (if you don't have
<code>rsync</code>, there is certainly a package with this name in your
Linux distribution). 

You do not need root permissions if you install in your
home directory.
</p>

<p>
First copy the start script, called <code>gapsync</code>, into the current
directory using the following command (don't forget the trailing dot):
</p>
<pre>  rsync --port=873 -azv rsync.gap-system.org::gap-rsync/gapsync/gapsync .
</pre>
<p>
Now call this script (as root or with <code>sudo</code> prepended if you 
want to install in system directories, see below):
</p>
<pre>  ./gapsync
</pre>
<p>
You are asked for two directories. The first is for the installation. 
Everything is copied into a subdirectory <code>gap-rsync</code> 
of this directory
(the default is <code>/usr/local/lib</code>). The second directory should be
one in your standard path of executable programs, the scripts to start <span
class="pkg">GAP</span> will be put there (the default is
<code>/usr/local/bin</code>).
<br />
<p>If some of these scripts exist already you will be asked if they can be
deleted. Move them away first if you want to keep them.
</p>
<p>After specifying these two directories, answer <code>y</code> to the next
question to start the installation. Depending on your network connection
you can use <span class="pkg">GAP</span> after two to ... minutes (about
700&nbsp;MB must be transferred via the internet).
</p>
<p>You can now delete the script you started with:</p>
<pre>  rm ./gapsync
</pre>

<h2>How to call <span class="pkg">GAP</span></h2>
<p>
The following scripts are provided by this distribution:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>gapL</code></dt>
<dd>for calling <span class="pkg">GAP</span> with a saved workspace.
This is the recommended way to start <span class="pkg">GAP</span>, it
is faster than calling <code>gap</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>gap</code></dt>
<dd>for calling <span class="pkg">GAP</span></dd>
<dt><code>gapsync</code></dt>
<dd>for updating this <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation</dd>
<dt><code>xgap</code></dt>
<dd>for using <span class="pkg">GAP</span> via an X11 interface with graphical
capabilities (but no terminal capabilities in its main window). </dd>
<dt><code></code></dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Updating this <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation</h2>

<p>You can update the installation by calling the script
</p>
<pre>   gapsync
</pre>
<p>which was installed during initialization and mentioned above. The
synchronization will usually take just a few seconds. A new workspace is 
created after each synchronization locally.</p>
<p>An update should not be made while a <span class="pkg">GAP</span>
job is running. If you have long running jobs do not use an automatic, say
nightly, update.</p>

<h2>Removing this installation</h2>
<p>To remove this <span class="pkg">GAP</span> installation use the
script <code>remove</code> in the 
subdirectory <code>gapsync</code> of your installation:
</p>
<pre>   &lt;path to your installation&gt;/gapsync/remove
</pre>
Or, if you are not sure about the path, use the following 
within <span class="pkg">GAP</span> to print the command with full path:
<pre>    Print(Concatenation(First(GAPInfo.RootPaths, p-&gt;
                    Filename([Directory(p)],"lib/init.g") <> fail), 
                    "/gapsync/remove\n"));
</pre>

<p>This just deletes the links to the  scripts mentioned above and the
whole installation directory (starting <code>gap-rsync</code>), so including
any custom installations in the <code>gap-rsync/local</code> subdirectory.
</p>
<p>You can also just delete or forget about the <code>gapsync</code> script
and use the installed <span class="pkg">GAP</span> like any standard
installation.
</p>

<h2>User customization in general</h2>
<p>Customization can be done in a users home directory, if is contains
a subdirectory <code>~/.gap/</code>.
An easy way to make use of this is to call in a  
<span class="pkg">GAP</span>&nbsp; session the command
</p>
<pre>    WriteGapIniFile();
</pre>
<p>
This creates the <code>~/.gap/</code> directory (if necessary) and the file
<code>~/.gap/gap.ini</code>. Look into this file and adjust some of the
settings as you like (e.g., specify packages (not) to load, color prompt,
<code>less</code> as pager, ...). 
If you create a file  
<code>~/.gap/gaprc</code> then it will be read by <span
class="pkg">GAP</span> during startup.
</p>

<h2>Customization of this installation</h2>
<p>
You can customize the <code>gap</code>,  <code>gapL</code>,
<code>gapsync</code> scripts by editing the files in the
<code>local/bin</code> subdirectory of this <span class="pkg">GAP</span>
installation.
</p>
<p>
You can customize the workspace used in your installation by copying
<code>gapsync/CreateWorkspace.sh</code> to
<code>local/bin/CreateWorkspace</code> 
and editing the latter.
For example, you may want another set of packages preloaded.
</p>
<p>Additional packages can be installed in the <code>local/pkg</code>
subdirectory.
</p>
<p>Whenever you have changed something in the installation call
<code>gapsync</code> which will produce an updated workspace.
</p>
<p>
If you change things outside the <code>local</code> subdirectory they are
deleted with the next call of <code>gapsync</code>. If you find errors in
this part, please report them.

<h2>Notes on this installation, in particular packages</h2>
<p>The packages 
<span class="pkg">Alnuth</span>, 
<span class="pkg">HAP</span>,
<span class="pkg">polymaking</span>, 
<span class="pkg">singular</span>,  
and 
<span class="pkg">SgpViz</span> 
need or suggest further 
external software, and may not work immediately with full functionality. 
<p>
The package <span class="pkg">PolymakeInterface</span> is currently only
unpacked but not installed.
</p>
<p>Note that the <span class="pkg">AtlasRep</span> package contains
directories <code>gap4r4/pkg/atlasrep/data*</code> which are world writable
(for caching downloaded representations). These are emptied with any update
of this distribution.</p>
<p>If you don't want this you can customize the script
<code>gap-rsync/local/bin/gapsync</code> in your installation, add the options 
<code>--exclude=pkg/atlasrep/datagens --exclude=pkg/atlasrep/dataword</code>
to the <code>rsync</code> call (search the line containing
<code>--port</code>).
</p>

<p>You can customize  details of the installation of
<strong>any  package</strong> by copying that package to the directory
<code>gap-rsync/local/pkg</code>. You can also install <strong>additional 
packages</strong> there.</p>

<h2><a name="32versus64">How about the 32-bit version of <span
class="pkg">GAP</span>?</a></h2>

<p>
Nowadays there seems to be little reason to install and use GAP in
32-bit mode. In this mode GAP would use less RAM (and could not use more than
2 GB of RAM), but it would run slower
on most machines.
