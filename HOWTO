    HOWTO prepare a GAP installation for rsync distribution (Linux)
    ===============================================================

  1. Make sure that sufficient tools, libraries and header files are
     installed on your system. In Debian/Ubuntu and derived distributions
     the following should do:

         apt-get install curl build-essential autoconf libtool \
                         libgmp-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev \
                         libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
                         libcurl4-openssl-dev \
                         libx11-dev libxaw7-dev libxt-dev \
                         libcdd-dev libzmq3-dev libboost-all-dev \
                         libmpfr-dev libmpfi0-dev libmpc-dev
  
  2. Make sure you have ./patchelf in your PATH (if needed 
     regenerate it with ./make_patchelf).

  3. Download latest GAP release gap*.tar.gz into build directory from
         https://www.gap-system.org/Releases/
     [ temporarily, copy Browse-1.8.11.1.tar.gz in same directory ]
     Also copy the 'gapsync' subdirectory from here to directory of archive.

  4. Call the script
         InstallForRsync > instlog
     from this directory within the build directory.
     Check instlog for problems.

  5. Call the script
         TestsForRsync > testlog
     from this directory within the build directory.


    To update the distribution
    ==========================
    
  1. Restart the plan above from 3.

  2. Save old VERSIONS file with a command like 
      sed -e "s/GAPVersion/GAPVersionold/" VERSIONS | \
         sed -e "s/PackageVersions/PackageVersionsold/" > ~/VERISONSold
    Then generate new section for website/CHANGES file with
      gap  <oldversionfile> <newversionfile> ./genCHANGES

  3. Maybe update website/index.html

  4. Copy new files for distribution to rsync server in directory
       gap@rsync.gap-system.org/home/gap/rsyncfiles/gap-rsync
     and restart rsync server.

  5. Update website
       cp website/{index.html,CHANGES,*.css}  \
                     ~/MyWWWHome/web/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPrsync/

   

We prepare and update the distribution  on a virtual machine with
Ubuntu Server 16.04 system to make sure that the code will run with the
basic libraries (libc, libm, libpthread, libdl) on all reasonably up-to-date
Linux systems.


          Starting the rsync server
          =========================

  1. Create (virtual) server rsync.math.rwth-aachen,de
                           = rsync.gap-system.org
     with user 'gap', home directory /home/gap.

  2. Copy (maybe adjust) 
           rsyncd.conf
           startrsyncserver
     there.
  
  3, Copy the files to distribute in
        /home/gap/rsyncfiles/
  
  4. To run the rsync server with default port 873 we call the
     start script /home/gap/startrsyncserver from the /etc/rc.local
     file (by root, dropping the service to gap.gap afterwards).

  5. At RWTH we need to apply at NOC to open the port 873 on
     rsync.gap-system.org
